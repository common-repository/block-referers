It can also effect your rankings in Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a referrer? =

The HTTP referrer is a HTTP header field that is sent when a browser goes from one page to another. When a user clicks a link, the user’s browser makes a request to the server that holds the desired web page. That request includes the HTTP referrer field, which identifies the last page that the user was on when they clicked the link.

This information is useful for website owners because it allows them to see where their traffic originates from. You can either view the data in your server web logs or with a service like Google Analytics.
